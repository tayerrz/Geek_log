<p>你好，我是英语专栏的编辑阿锦，欢迎来到第8期的“每周一起背10句”。</p><p>不知不觉，我们的课程已经进行了2个月啦，很快就要进入尾声了。本周我们主要学习了阅读和写作技巧相关的内容，比如paraphrase、金字塔原理。专栏已经过了大半，不知道学到现在你对英语学习有没有找到什么感觉呢？你可以在留言区说说你现在对于英语学习的感想，我们一起聊聊。</p><p>本周呢，我们没有读新的文章，主要侧重讲了一些方法，因此，我们今天来做一些练习。你来试着用paraphrase的两种技巧——词汇替换和句子结构调整，来改写一下下面这几段话，重点词汇我已经给你标注在里面了。快来试试吧！</p><hr><p><strong>This one</strong> seems to <strong>make</strong> sense – if engineers were creative, wouldn’t they have decided to be artists, writers, or some other "<strong>Fine Arts" profession</strong>? Wrong!</p><p>The key word in <strong>being creative</strong> is right there – to create! Engineers create products, services, and processes that influence people every day.</p><!-- [[[read_end]]] --><p>Whether <strong>your work goes into</strong> consumer applications, devices, or machines, the <strong>end product</strong> of engineering work is used by other people.</p><p>If engineers <strong>suppressed</strong> their creativity, they would <strong>miss out on</strong> a lot of <strong>insights</strong> into ways to solve problems than they otherwise would.</p><p>Every day, engineers need to find new ways to <strong>think outside the box</strong> to <strong>tackle new challenges</strong>.</p><p>They have the <strong>fabulous</strong> opportunity and responsibility of imagining ways in which the world could be different and then creating ways to make that happen.</p><p>That is <strong>at the heart of</strong> what creativity is all about and it should be <strong>inspiring and exciting</strong> for engineers.</p><p>For example, engineering innovations have been a big part of healthcare <strong>improvement</strong> over the years.</p><p>From data analysis to efficient software systems, to surgery machines, to providing treatment tracking and recommendations, engineering truly saves lives daily.</p>
